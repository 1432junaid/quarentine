Exception:
	is an undesirable situation while process is running
	if it has not been handled, process will terminate.

my words:
	a exception genrates when we are right but somehow there is a barrior in the compiler or 
	even compiler donn't know about that ,then we have to think and try another approach to 
	rid over it that is called the exception was generate and we handled.
	Ex :
		we r going to lko to kanpur but for some reasons there is a barrier 
		and we take back and try diferent way in order to reach kanpur.

Three keywords to handle Exception:
	1. try[used to define a block]
	2. catch[used to define a block]
	3. throw[used to throw object from a particular point in process]

	try{
		statements;	//that can throw exception when executed
		......
		.....
	}catch(int& a){
		......		//catch have reference or pointer
		instruction through which exception will be handled.
	}

[note: a try can have multiple catch]

	try{
		.......(throw int type object)
		.......(throw string type object)
	}catch(reference or ponter){
		.......int throw
		.......
	}catch(refernce or pointer){
		.......string throw
		.......
	}
[note: try can throw only one exception at a time for ex: if try throw first statement then then next throw will never thrown]
